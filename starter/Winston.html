                        <p class="mt-4 mb-3"> Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, KG, OM, CH, TD, DL, FRS, RA was a britisher statesman, soldier and aristocrat born to Lord and Lady Churchill who belonged to the Marlborough House of the UK. Sir Churchill served as the Prime Minister of UK and preceding to serving his time as the PM, he was positioned at various cabinet ranks. He was born on 30th of November in 1874 at Blenheim Palace, Blenheim, Oxfordshire, England which was a stately residence belonging to his family and primarily owned by the Duke of Marlborough. His family on the paternal side as suggested previously were high serving members of the British services even including the First Duke of Marlborough who is still recognised as one of the most renowned generals of the Royal Army. His father, Sir Randolph Churchill was also a political figure serving as His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India and The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister of UK) but he was unfortunately removed from the position following a miserably failing budget presented by him. Following this incident Lord Randolph lost his urge for socialising, was humiliated and lived his remaining life away from the light and passed away of syphilis at the young age of 45.
                          </p>
                            <p class="mb-3"> Winston was never an academic, he was an outdoorsy person who was the epitome of mediocrity. He attended Harrow School, the most reputed school in the nation then. He later joined the defence academy and rolled in as a cadet in the cavalry. He served on important missions in countries like India, Sudan and Cuba. Churchill fought multiple wars and was even arrested by some tribes in the countries. Following this period he swore to never return to a battlefield and decided to join politics to save British Armed Forces from the dreadfulness he faced. Although Churchill was unable to keep his word, he went to the Second Boer war in South Africa as a journalist and lived there for sometime and covered for the Morning Post. After his return to the UK he joined the conservative party and fought the seat at Oldham and became a member of parliament at the mere age of 25. His maiden speech was highly applauded by the country setting out the new name in the crowd of 650 most influential people of the country. Although supported by the Conservatives, Churchill and Conservatives never ended up on the same page and as the differences widened, Churchill Finally crossed the floor to join the ruling liberals in 1904.
                              </p>
                            <p class="mb-3"> He contested the elections with a new seat in 1906 and was this time made an Under Secretary of State for the colonial office, which is equivalent to being an MoS in India. Churchill was bumped up to the cabinet in 1908 as the President of the Trade Board, he was the youngest cabinet Minister that the UK had seen in the past 40 Years. He was then promoted to be the Home Secretary in 1910 where he was heavily criticised for being at an event in Sidney Street where a building was burnt while people were occupying it. To save face of the Home Department Churchill was moved to the position of the First Lord of Admiralty. He served in such offices till 1915 when he resigned his positions to go and fight in the war, again breaking his promise to himself. Another reason for him to resign was that he was involved in the biggest blunder of the British Navy ever where they lost many fleets and soldiers at Gallipoli. Gallipoli also saw the loss of Dr. Moseley, the Maker of the modern periodic table. After the war Churchill rejoined the cabinet as Secretary of State for War and he was enjoyed rather than frowned upon his entry. 
                              </p>
                            <p class="mb-3"> Churchill left the office and parliament in 1922 and was out of power till 1924. In 1924 he again switched parties to join Conservatives again who  surprisingly were forgiving of their humiliation caused by Churchill when he switched in 1904. In 1924 he was appointed as the Chancellor of the Exchequer to which he served at an amazing rapport till 1929 when his term expired. Churchill did not hold a ministerial position in the government in spite of the conservatives ruling. This dry spell continued for the next 10 years but he was still an active member of the house and was still in headlines for his controversial favourings like favouring the dominion status for India and favouring HM King Edward VIII, Later and now posthumously the Duke of Edinburgh. He was also sharp tongued about the rise of Hitler from the very beginning and criticised PM Neville Chamberlain for his appeasement strategies which failed miserably and showed the world the power of Hitler and unpreparedness of the UK for an upcoming war.</p>
                            
                            <p class="mb-3"> He was made the First lord of Admiralty in 1939 and was then promoted to be the Prime Minister as a coalition deal between the Labour and Conservatives. This was seen as an appropriate option for the parties as they considered him to be a puppet of both sides but rather he turned out to be the puppeteer of the two parties upon gaining power. In the war he managed all the fronts to utmost perfection and his management and ability to keep the nation motivated lead the UK from being a country about to succumb to fascism to being the victor of the war. His ways of motivating the crowd brought about a sense of patriotism and allegiance to the King. But in spite of his amazing war efforts and successes the country voted him out in the following elections to choose Clement Atlee who undid all the plans Churchill had in mind to make UK stronger than ever post the war. This was understood by the populace very later and it was only in 1950 that Atlee was replaced with Churchill again. This time Churchill had the burden of managing the nation with a King suffering from Cancer and making way for a new Queen for the country who was among the youngest of all monarchs and was never in the hopes or preparations for being a Queen but this too was managed well by him as seen by us even today by the successful times of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. He resigned from premiership in 1955 for age concerns. He lived for 9 more years in which he was offered to be made the Duke of London but his son being a decision maker in this matter denied considering his political future. He passed away on 24th of January in 1964 with his last words being -”I am done with it all”.
